This is some longer text.  Hello,
My girlfriend and me have done dating for 5 month. I thought &ldquo;This girl is very good,&rdquo; and became of love with her.
Yet even so, on this Monday, I comed home and found she as baked all my beans.
Yes, all. Oh brother.
In my cupboard I store several bag of bean, to make soft and to bake on some days, to have a bit of baked bean on my dinner. Or, heck, a lunch too some days.
But on the Monday I find this girlfriend baked all the beans. I say &ldquo;Why do you bake my beans&rdquo;, and she say something as &ldquo;I bakes them good to save time, so I bakes them all now.&rdquo;
I am astonished and full of dissmay. I say &ldquo;I canfr not eat all the beans&rdquo;, she say she is froze many of the beans so as we can unfrozen the on a later day and eat some at a time." />
